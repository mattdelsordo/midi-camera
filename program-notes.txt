Title: Beats by Hammy
By: Fayth Kim and Matt DelSordo
Intro: often times, DJs just don't know what the crowd wants. That is why we put the important task of creating
the music to a pet hamster named Wasabi. The program functions by generating sounds as Wasabi runs in his ball.
Using a webcam that is mounted above a square fencing (in order to keep Wasabi in an enclosed area), python
scripts using OpenCV were used to detect whether Wasabi runs in or out of defined 4x4 grid squares. All the squares
are initialized as 'off', but if Wasabi runs into a square, pixel color changes trigger it as 'on' (and vice versa), 
where midi signals then are sent to chuck where the midi messages are processed. In the 4x4 grid, each 1x1 square is assigned a different
sound pattern or song (w/ respective .ck files). The generated sound files were a curated selection of hamster/rodent
noises, well-known hamster-based tunes, and drum patterns. For a better listening experience in the generated song,
the BPM of the 'Hamster Dance' song (136) was used as a standard in which other BPMs were to. In addition, a queue was made
for each midi/chuck process so that sound files were either turned off or on on the first down beat. DJ Wasabi the hamster 
may choose to create a different mix each time which results in unforgettable performances every time!
